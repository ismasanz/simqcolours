\begin_layout Abstract
An application that computes the approximate description of the perceived
 color of an image has been developed.
 Some experiments have been conducted to prove the validity of the descriptions
 obtained.
 Finally, some conclusions about the accuracy of the image analysis and
 the validity of the used QCD model have been draft.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to make perception usable by consciousness, humans attach labels
 to remarkable features of stimulus.
 We bring out essential characteristics of things so that a classification
 can be performed and further abstract work can be developed.
 Colour is one of these essential characteristics.
 Any technology which goal is to reproduce some level of human intelligence,
 or plainly involves human-machine communication regarding the environment
 (for instance, assistive technology), must be able to successfully recognize
 and categorize colours.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A great effort has been done during recent years to mimic the color naming
 capabilities of humans.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 reviewed at least ten approaches to color-naming using different colour
 models.
 These authors have focused on reproducing a cognitive centered colour-naming,
 in order to achieve a description of colours as close as possible to that
 of humans.
 Their approach uses the HSL colour space and defines a model for Qualitative
 Colour Description (QCD) by dividing the former into intervals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this project is to implement an easy to use application to test
 extensively the validity of the proposed QCD model.
 The architecture of the software should be in accordance with principles
 of the model: 
\emph on

The application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application must take an image as its input and analyze it to extract
 the most common color.
 Then apply the QCD colour-naming model of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "falomir-museros-gonzalez"

\end_inset

 to obtain a 
\emph on
human understandable 
\emph default
linguistic description of the color.
 The most common color and the 
\emph on
obtained description
\emph default
 are shown to the user and she is asked to do a review of the result.
 If the description is not right, user is asked (1) to input her own freely
 expressed description, and (2) to pick one of the descriptions allowed
 by this QCD model.
 Review of the result for a given image can be performed by any number of
 subjects.
 The information of the reviews is used to generate basic statistics about
 the adequateness of the obtained description.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Technology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An application that meets this requirements has been developed using 
\emph on
web
\emph default
 technologies.
 The most solid reason to choose this technology is its widespread use and
 ubiquity, comparable to that of a virtual machine like Java.
 Almost any machine has a web browser installed, and usually it is a fundamental
 tool kept up to date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commonly the web architecture involves a client web-browser and a server
 dispensing web pages.
 With the newest HTML version --five--, the standard has been augmented
 with new powerful features that enrich the client-side and can be used
 to operate it independently, like a classical desktop application.
 We have taken advantage of this features to build a web application that
 can be read both from a local filesystem or a web server and operated without
 access to the Internet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
User interface design is done by HTML/CSS, and the logic programming with
 ECMAScript (mostly known as JavaScript).
 We have reused libraries and code from other open projects in order to
 fasten the development:

Colours

\begin_layout Standard
The QCD model is defined for the HSL colour space, thus the image colours
 must be converted from RGB(A) to HSL color space.
 This can be done easily since HSL is just

Image analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When browser receives the image from the user, we use an HTML5 canvas element
 to draw the image an gain access to the pixel information.
 Pixel information is stored in unidimensional array where groups of 4 positions
 (channels R,G,B,A) represent a single pixel.
 The array is reorganized to explicitly express its 3 dimensions (alpha
 is discarted) and then apply the k-means clustering algorithm to find out
 the 
\emph on
k 
\emph default
centroids and the pixel assignments.
 Parameter 
\emph on
k 
\emph default
is configurable in the user interface and represents the number clusters
 to ultimately be found on the image.
 The adequacy of this parameter depends on each image, but a safe default
 of 4 has been established.
 We use the Euclidean distance as a measure of proximity.
 The implementation of the k-means algorithm itself comes from project Figue

\end_layout

\end_inset

; we felt it was better to rely on optimized and well tested code.
 Moreover, all the work is done on a downscaled version of the original
 image in order to speed up the clustering.
 We rely on the native scaling algorithm present in the web browser.
 It is very good in current Mozilla Firefox 22, but might be different for
 other vendors.
 The size for the downscaling might be configured as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Methods regarding the analysis of the image have been packaged onto a jQuery
 plug-in (source is at 
\family typewriter
jquery.canvasimage.js
\family default
).
 The plugin adds a function 
\family typewriter
createAnalyzer(resize, k)
\family default
 to the jQuery prototype, so that this function might be called from any
 jQuery wrapped DOM element.
 Nevertheless calling this function only makes sense when the wrapped DOM
 element is an 
\family typewriter
img
\family default
 tag.
 In that case, the function will return a new 
\family typewriter
CanvasImage
\family default
 object.
 This object emits two events:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
'load'
\family default
 when the image data has been loaded and resized into the internal canvas,
 and the object is ready to perform an analysis.
 When this event triggers, it is save to call 
\family typewriter
analyze()
\family default
 on the object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
'analyzed'
\family default
 when k-means has ended.
 Once this event has triggered, results of the k-means algorithm can be
 found on property 
\family typewriter
result
\family default
 of the object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Property
\family typewriter
 result
\family default
 contains the original k-means result (
\family typewriter
assignments
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
centroids
\family default
) and an additional 
\family typewriter
rank
\family default
 property.
 
\family typewriter
rank 
\family default
is an array of perceptions sorted by relevance.
 First object in the array is the most relevant perception, with the percentage
 of pixels assigned to this perception and the centroids that where classified
 as belonging to this perception, also in descending relevance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of an image analysis is presented to the user side by side to
 the analyzed image.
 It consists of the most relevant perception label (for instance 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dark red
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), shown over a box filled with the color of the winner centroid (the one
 that got the most number of assignments among all the centroids that fullfill
 this very same perception label).

Our image analysis presented here is very simple and does not account for
 color constancy or spatial relations among colors.
 First reason for this is the size of this project, and second, the expected
 target of images is going to be fairly plain (closeups of fabrics).
 To adapt the application to be used with any kind of image, a correction
 method described by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Some very minimal statistics are shown.
 Management of each individual image is done by clicking on it.
 All the information of an image (color analysis, user reviews, etc.) is
 managed as a backbone model, contained into a backbone collection.
 The collection is permanently saved in the local storage of the web browser.

The tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Design of the tests has been very simple.
 It consisted on the selection of 37 images, each one apparently fitting
 on one of the 37 color names considered by the QCD model.
 Each image analysis has been repeated with different parameters, to observe
 the variation on the results, and avoid saving an uncommon result (like
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cometee of machines).
 Finally results have been reviewed by two independent users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Experiments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application successfully has output 
\emph on

 In general this proves the correct operation of the analysis, and the correct
 definition of ranges for each qualitative color.

\begin_layout Standard
We consider (a), (c), and (d) to fall into a common case of a

\end_inset

 problem in the hue scale.
 It is quite difficult to solve, and divergences may arise due to cultural
 differences, display conditions, and subjective perception.
 It is the less serious of the errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would call case (a) and (e) plainly erroneus, and a bit alarming.
 Case (a) 
\family typewriter
hsl(130, 88%, 32%) 
\family default
is an example of how values in the saturation and lightness scales can modify
 the established intervals of each other.
 Based on this case we could argue that higher values of saturation influence
 downward the DARK - RAINBOW lightness frontier.
 Case (e) 
\family typewriter
hsl(300, 12%, 48%) 
\family default
is a painfull example of how same values of saturation or lightness are
 not enough evidence to classify a color in the grayscale category.
 For some values of hue, for instance 
\family typewriter
200
\family default
, we would consider the grayscale category acceptable.
 In this case, whether we are too much influenced by our own perception,
 or the values of the model are wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider case (f) to be more of an analysis error than a model error.
 In this case most of the image is very dark, an just obtaining the most
 common color is not enough to find out the right perception.
 The reason lies on the fact that the color of the few light areas influences
 greatly the perception of the whole, because humans rely on the light areas
 to infer which the dark color might be.
 In this case, a previous correction of the image might pose a solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, some subjects might think that some variations of a pure rainbow
 color should deserve their own specific name, like case (d) where the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

dark red
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is suggested to be callled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

brown

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions and further work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The few experiments done reveal some failures on the analysis of the image,
 and color description approximation defined by the QCD model.
 Further work on the analysis should involve previous treatment and correction
 of the image.
 We feel the QCD model is a bit harsh trying to keep color-naming as simple
 as possible.
 Some color names could be added.
 Also it would be nice to give a try to a more dynamic interval system,
 in which frontiers among categories would be influenced by values of the
 other scales.
 Anyhow it is crystal clear that more testing should be done to draw any
 solid conclusion.
